/*
 1. App should use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
2. The page should display a grid of buttons containing numbers from 1-25
3. The initial class name of any button containing numbers must be “tile” with a hex
code of rgb(27, 62, 119) and this color may NOT be used anywhere else in the
exercise.
4. Numbers should have a randomized order
5. When a user clicks a number, if it is the next number in order, then its background
turns a different color for the remainder of the test. If it is the wrong number,
nothing happens
6. Once all numbers have been clicked in order, display a win message with the text
“You Win!”.
7. Include a button to start a new game at any time with the text content “Start!”.
8. Hitting the “Start!” button defaults to starting a game containing 25 numbers and
clicking the start button on subsequent clicks defaults to starting a game
containing 25 numbers and will shuffle the numbers and restart the game. No
other buttons to start a game are allowed.

//need to make a loop adding numbers into an array up to max number 
//should be like while i<max array.push i
//rng to select a number from the array that is UNIQUE
//maybe just need to guarantee the array value is unique? so if array[random] = array[random] then jump to top
/* since we are doing input max we need to have the HTML grid be of variable height/width, 
could maybe do width=sqrt(max) or maybe set it a rectangle? */
